-- Multilingual is the important piece in the above question. It was created using POSITION(',' IN languages)>0 logic
-- If there is a comma, that means the movie is of more than one language


-- Q28. Who are the top 3 actresses based on the number of Super Hit movies (Superhit movie: average rating of movie > 8) in 'drama' genre?

-- Note: Consider only superhit movies to calculate the actress average ratings.
-- (Hint: You should use the weighted average based on votes. If the ratings clash, then the total number of votes
-- should act as the tie breaker. If number of votes are same, sort alphabetically by actress name.)
