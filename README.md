## 📄 Executive Summary

> **Executive Summary – IMDb SQL Project**

This project focuses on the analysis of an IMDb-style movie dataset using advanced SQL querying techniques. The primary goal was to extract meaningful business insights from over 10,000 movie records by exploring multiple dimensions such as genres, ratings, votes, countries, and production companies. The analysis was conducted on a relational database schema manually built using MySQL Workbench, which included tables such as `movie`, `genre`, `ratings`, `names`, `role_mapping`, and `director_mapping`.

The project began with data modeling and schema creation, followed by data ingestion through a structured SQL script. Using SQL, I explored key questions including: Which genres dominate in terms of volume and ratings? Who are the top-rated actors, actresses, and directors? What distinguishes a superhit movie from a flop? And which production houses lead the industry globally and regionally?

Notable insights included:
- **Drama** emerged as the most produced genre.
- **Germany and India** showed high movie production activity.
- **Directors like James Mangold** and **actors like Vijay Sethupathi** topped rating charts.
- Genre classification helped categorize movies into Superhit, Hit, One-time-watch, or Flop based on average ratings.

Advanced SQL techniques like **window functions, subqueries, ranking functions, and CTEs** were used to answer 29 complex business problems, simulating the decision-making needs of a film production company.

This project demonstrates how structured data and the right querying approach can uncover trends and guide strategic planning in the entertainment industry.
